Introduction


"s3mαntiC0//4pøk∆l¥ps!_<シ垔÷言吾/☨丶》" is a VR audiovisual environment that speculates an imaginary plausible future of post-linguistic/semiotic world by queering post-human language into a possible reconstruction of glitchy digital signals- echoing the aesthetic of rave and club culture. Within the dystopian narrative of meaning collapse, language no longer functions as a stable vehicle for communication but instead disintegrates into fragments, loops and noise- resonating as emotional, sonic and visual textures. Experiencers traverse a storytelling-embedded cyber landscape where physical and virtual reality weave and overlap, and where linguistic entropy becomes a sensory field.





Impetus


“#IYKYK:)”
I, as a Gen-Z netizen, am a participant in the ongoing algorithmic generation, circulation and mutation of internet language. Memes, shorthand, autofill and machine-optimized phrasing reshape how we express thought, often before we even think it. We are trapped within automated content curation controlled by a large tech corps where the language we encounter is filtered, personalized, and isolated. Personified feeds fragment collective discourse, placing each of us in algorithmically separated linguistic bubbles. Algorithms have created a new Babel: a digital landscape where everyone is speaking, but few are truly heard; a reality where information is less in_formed. In such a new Babel, miscommunication is not the exception— it is the rule.

“🗣️🔓fr33d0m”
I, as a witness to linguistic subversion under censorship, have seen how people invent new forms of language online— not to communicate more clearly, but to bypass the state-enforced sensitive word monitoring and to avoid being silenced. The use of language is also a political battlefield. Every recreated phrase, twisted character, or intentional glitch is not just a stylistic choice but a strategic act of resistance. The recreation of language becomes a way to express the inexpressible, to refer to the forbidden, and to speak up while appearing silent. Meaning hides in mispronunciation, homophones and visual code— spoken not directly, but through detour. 

”Oh 不bù no“
I, as a bilingual individual, live in the entanglement of two distinct language systems that often misalign. Words get lost in translation— not just across languages, but across emotional registers, cultural codes, and temporal logic. Some of my thoughts can only be felt in my mother tongue but can never be expressed in an alien language. Some of the fleeting moments can only be described in a specific word in this language but speakers of that can never understand. The barriers are here and there, existing, evolving and regenerating.

“My Language
              has
F-ailed me.”
I, as a person with ADHD symptoms, experience language not as linear expression, but as abstract overflow— too many thoughts, disjointed syntax, abandoned sentences. I want to construct them but can hardly capture the essences. I want to clarify but often ‘messify’.

So hereby, I seek to create—and imagine—a language in which meaning is not spoken, but felt; not fixed, but queered. A language that slips, glitches, pulses. A language that survives collapse as resistance. A language that echoes critics. 


The Conceptual and Technological Framework: Contexts, Research and Methodology

To construct and imagine a post-human language, this project borrows from linguistics as both science and metaphor. By reconfiguring classical linguistic categories through posthumanist, queer, and techno-critical lenses, each section of the system mirrors a collapsed or mutated layer of language structure.

The “Etymology”: Conceptual Origin

As discussed in the Impetus, my living experience across linguistic systems and algorithmic cultures revealed the deepening alienation of language in computational society. The etymology here is not the root of a single word, The etymology here is not the root of a single word, but a speculative return to the conditions under which language itself breaks down.

As philosopher Bernard Stiegler reminds us, language is a technological form—it extends more memory than the biological, and brings subjectivity into time and death. When algorithms dominate a culture of real-time metrics and machinic extrapolation, language finds itself no longer on the ground of temporality but on the side of the code.
In the tradition of speculative design, theorists Dunne & Raby who state that their work "makes the familiar strange"—this installation shares this ethic. Language as presumed natural becomes unstable interface under regulation, automation and glitch.

The "Phonology": Sonic Fracture of Disembodied Waves
If phonology used to pertain to the organization of sound units in human language, this project conceives of phonology as the fragmented byproduct of deanimated rhythm. In such a phonic system, the kicks become percussive markers of mechanical urgency, the basses become tonal anchors of synthetic gravity, the snares become digital stutters of emphasis — as Sound detaches from voice, the glitched loops appear as phonemes.
With Ableton Live, I devised layered rhythms mimicking the form of failing speech: interrupts, stutters and phase loops. This is in response to Katherine Hayles’ claim that “pattern” substitutes for “presence” in posthuman systems–the rhythm is no longer an expression but repetition.

The “Morphology”: Visual Fragments of Mutated Glyphs

The installation visualizes glitch-glyphs: mutated characters built from corrupted Unicode, spiraling ASCII, and GBK fragments. They evoke morphology not as coherent word-units, but as failed attempts at form.
Here, Donna Haraway’s cyborg reappears—not as body-machine fusion, but as alphabet-machine disturbance. The characters do not represent; they leak, drift, echo. Judith Butler's theory of performativity also informs this: the glyphs do not precede meaning—they produce and destabilize it through repetition and variation.

The "Semantics": Recomposing Meanings and Unmeaning meanings
If semantics is the link between signifier and signified, then this project disrupts signage. Language itself doesn’t point here — it swirls, echoes, lingers. Meaning is not essential to this piece— look at the unmeaning. The process of creation in this piece involves experimentations, spontaneously sparkling ideas and swirling messy thoughts. The unmeaning of assets, collages, installment, music loops means meaning itself.
In “Cruising Utopia,” by José Muñoz, queerness is defined as “a mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present.” The semantic system of this project is in line with that logic: meaning is not there, but it has been postponed, is on the run, or else has escaped altogether. The installation asks you to read into gibberish as signal and silence as a statement.
Sense arises not from lucidity but from echo, from the association and dissociation of ideas.

The "Syntax": Technical Logic of the System

The syntax of this system is not grammatical but machine-based. Devices, data streams, and feedback loops compose a new sentence—one that performs rather than speaks.
Drawing from Alexander Galloway’s Protocol, the logic of the system emerges not from rules of speech but from protocols of connection. Communication is enacted through packet routing, real-time rendering, and non-linguistic triggers.
The Meta Quest 2 acts as the embodied sensorium. Ableton Live sends evelelope data through OSC controls the Niagara particle systems in Unreal Engine as responsive utterances. Touchdesigner Spout Out Operator communicates through Off World Livestream Live Camera plug-in to Unreal Engine, mapping the sky texture of the virtual world. On another computer, Touchdesigner also reads the depth map data of camera capture, recreates the 2d data in 3d and later generates glitchy 2d real-time motion graphic.Syntax here is not linear, but recursive and feedback-based. 

The "Pragmatics": Interaction as Interpretation
In classical pragmatics, meaning arises in context, through usage. In this project, interaction becomes the interpretive act.
Meaning is not assigned by the system but co-constructed with the participant. Every action generates a different output, none of which is definitive. This aligns with Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism: the observer is part of the phenomenon.
The participant is both reader and rewriter. There is no stable referent—only entangled response.

The "Metalinguistics": Tech-Lingo Symbiosis
This section reflects on the techno-semiotic feedback loop: how digital systems not only process language, but transform what language is.
Terms like “latency,” “signals”and“output” are not just technical—they have become part of our linguistic consciousness. In doing so, they reshape how we think about thought itself.
This aligns with Jean-François Lyotard’s The Postmodern Condition, where language games proliferate beyond control. In posthuman tech-speak, we no longer speak about meaning—we debug, parse, optimize, distort.
The system has become the grammar.

The "Poetic Reconstruction": Metaphors' Queer Rebuilt
Finally, this project is not devoid of poetics—it builds a new kind. Here, metaphor is not about “this is that,” but about “this might glitch into that” and “theses can create layers of meaning”.
As Paul B. Preciado writes in Testo Junkie, language is always already prosthetic. The poetics of this installation rest in its refusal to settle—each glitch, each reverb, each fragmented glyph becomes a queer metaphor in motion.
Besides the glitch, there are multiple layers of  metaphors in this project that awaits the audience to decode. The communications among hardwares and softwares through the cables, networks, and protocols, symbolizing the machine communication in post-human narrative. The overload of information  power creates latency in image processing.
Poetry survives the collapse of structure. In the fragments left behind, something flickers.






Prototyping and Iterations






In contrast to standard user testing, my prototyping journey did not culminate in salvaging or even refining isolated interactions. Instead it posed abstract but phenomenologically rooted questions: What did you see? What did you hear? What did it feel like? What emotion did the system give you back? Did the experience seem to you like one of language, or was it something quite different?
These were put to participants following brief VR-mediated interactions, in which the participant could enter the audiovisual space and interact through voice, silence or gesture. The eidetic feedback was never numerically quantified and related very fragmentarily in language, drawings or silence.
In others, short of words, participants floundered to even articulate what they’d met. Their umms, metaphors or refusals to answer were coded as significant data-points -- a sign that the project had succeeded in short-circuiting communicative expectation. One said it was like “entering a language that didn’t want to be understood,” another that he experienced as “I think I said something, but the world responded emotionally, not logically.”
Each iteration addressed these perceptions. Some images were deleted in order to leave more space for interpretation. Some hiccups stood out. The rhythmic patterns were polished to create increased tension or bafflement. The goal was never to make the system clearer, but to let it resonate more deeply in the participant’s sensorium.

Self-evaluation
This project was not to explain language, but rather to unmake it. I wasn’t trying to put one together, I was trying to let a shattered one speak. In that respect, the outcome reflects my original intent fairly well: to generate a space where the failure of language and transparency of access are visible, lovely, even desirable. And they told us not with words, but with presence—with their attention, their stillness, their willingness to remain within confusion.
At the very least, this project has shown me that meaning is not necessarily required for communication to take place. Shared instability is all we sometimes need.
I would like to grow this system in the future to adopt the form of a multi-user networked version, in which people of various disparate linguistic proclivities can engage with one another through partial hints and system noise, each engaging with their own semantic collapse.
