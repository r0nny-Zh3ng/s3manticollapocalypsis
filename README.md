Semantic + Collapse + Apocalypses 

Abstract

This thesis examines the failure and reconfiguration of speech in the time of algorithmic machines, artificial intelligence, and individual perception. The project is a VR audiovisual installation experience named s3mantiCo//apocAlyps! s, that portrays a post-linguistic world in which language ceases to be a communicative medium and becomes instead a series of noise, glitch, and aesthetic failure. Tapping into language phenomenology, queer theory, and media criticism, this study re-positions language not as malleable medium, but as a conflicted site for misrecognition, system fault, and affective dislocation. In this installation, language functions for its audience not as meaning, but as residue, collapse, and speculative material.

1. Introduction

"Language is not just an instrument for communication: it is also the house of Being."
— Martin Heidegger, Letter on Humanism (1947)

In the world of AI and fast computation, language becomes more abstracted in terms of machine-readable and processing-optimized formats. These practices, once known in and as situated, embodied, and phenomenological acts, have become parseable, tokenizable, and flattenable into regimes of information value. As this change occurs, we have to wonder: what happens to language’s ability to harbor subjectivity, ambiguity, and resistance?

Enter this project, s3mantiCo//apocAlyps! s, which is an immersive VR installation that builds a speculative space where language is  a substance that is taken apart and reassembled. In this world, language is not simply deployed to communicate; it permits itself to glitch, to shatter, to collapse. Turning the linguistic input into fragmented visual particles, AI-generated skyboxes and beat-based sound loops, the installation sabotages an established system of meaning and lures participants into post-linguistic sensorial reaction.

2. Impetus

From the widest possible angle of language philosophy, even to the micro-struggles of my stuttering, this project emerged not from a knowledge of language but from its ongoing failure within my experience. When you live between languages, you often wind up stuck in the middle of shards of sentences, jagged syntax, and expressions that never quite hit home. As a person with ADHD, my relation to language is nonlinear and overloaded: I think faster than I talk, words arrive at the same time rather than in order, and meaning is lost in the fog of overcompression.

The command to “speak clearly” or “write correctly” is a kind of continued erasure. It's always been the case that language has been organized for legibility, hierarchy, and control. But what if failure is not a bug but a mode of expression? Receiving a jolt from Jack Halberstam’s “the queer art of failure,” I started to regard those failures not as personal weak spots, but as political and aesthetic opportunities.

Rave culture's silence, with booming bass, strobes, and nonverbal unity, gave me another mode of communication. No speech. Just feeling. Just vibration. This project was born from the refusal of that linguistic coherence, and the recognition of the need for a space in which to make sense beyond the need for Sense.

3. Context & Research

This work is informed by a confluence of language phenomenology, queer theory, and media criticism. The gesture of Maurice Merleau-Ponty in suggesting that language is an embodied act composes the critique of algorithmic disembodiment. In Phenomenology of Perception, he states, “To speak is to lend the world a voice, and through language to make it available as a horizon of significance” (Merleau-Ponty, 1945). Language is not a purely abstract system of signs but a gesture of the body, rooted in experience. Remove such relational force from language (as we often do in machine learning systems, as systems that simply “deal” with language, reducing it to data to parse), and we not only lose subtlety, but the ontological basis of speaking.

Martin Heidegger also realizes that language is not a tool but the forming of a medium in which Being acquires a meaning. In his Letter on Humanism, Heidegger writes: “Language is the house of Being,” locating the working out of subject and world alongside each other as a dwelling in language. This idea is very important for s3mantiCo//apocAlyps! ies, in which language is consciously dismantled to reveal its infrastructural status in the construction of meaning.

How We Became Posthuman by N. Katherine Hayles offers a theoretical basis for looking at how language is overwritten when the move is made from presence to information. Her prosthesis provocation − “the body is the original prosthesis” and digital culture tries to do away with embodiment − is visually echoed with the installation’s focus on the splitting of text, voice, and space. The posthuman condition rearticulates language itself, not as a human function, but as a modulated sign.

The paper On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots (2021) by Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru directly criticizes GPT and other similar large language models. These systems are capable of generating grammatically correct text, though without any comprehension or context. Language becomes a surface phenomenon — procedural, repetitive, and vacuous. This critique is also the basis that informs the installation’s way of redirecting language inputs into gibberish or interpreted outputs, emphasizing the emotional burden of misunderstanding.

From the perspective of queer theory, these texts underpin the design of this project itself as a site where disorder, drift, and incompossibility are not mistakes of thinking, but the conditions of possibility of non-reconstituted forms of sensing. Failure is aesthetic and political, now. Muñoz's conception of queerness as “a mode of desiring that is not yet here” squares with the speculative nature of this work — here is a linguistic field upon which meaning has not yet set.

Lastly, the works of Alexander Galloway, Protocol: How Control Exists After Decentralization, and Wendy Chun, Updating to Remain the Same: Habitual New Media, place language as a technical object and a vector of control within a wider context of media theory. If these theories posit language itself as an interface, they also add fuel to the fire of the claim that disruption, glitch, and structural confusion can be the site of a productive critique, and of a feeling.

4. Methodology

The installation was created with Unreal Engine 5, Ableton Live, TouchDesigner, and ComfyUI. Audience voice or text data is captured through UI or via microphone, broken up by TouchDesigner, then re-routed to ComfyUI, where it processes the input to create AI-brain-driven looks for the sky and ambient video FX. Meanwhile, in UE5, audio data from Ableton modulates particle systems to encourage a dynamic, engaging relationship between sound and vision.

The focus was on the chain of translation: how the language is translated, distorted and then abused by each of those systems. It was never about preservation of meaning, but of its loss. This design rationale is informed through speculative prototyping and iterative testing with structured failures and studied mismatches. User comments included feedback collected during work-in-progress crits in which viewers described the feeling of ‘speaking into nothingness’ and ‘watching their words decay’. This structured the next versions of the visual system.

6. Self-Evaluation

This project was not to explain language, but rather to unmake it. I wasn’t trying to put one together, I was trying to let a shattered one speak. In that respect, the outcome reflects my original intent fairly well: to generate a space where the failure of language and transparency of access are visible, lovely, even desirable. And they told us not with words, but with presence—with their attention, their stillness, their willingness to remain within confusion.

At the very least, this project has shown me that meaning is not necessarily required for communication to take place. Shared instability is all we sometimes need.

I would like to grow this system in the future to adopt the form of a multi-user networked version, in which people of various disparate linguistic proclivities can engage with one another through partial hints and system noise, each engaging with their own semantic collapse.
